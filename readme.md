This repository contains the code, model, and outputs of the experimental implementation for the paper 
## "Exploiting Task Reversibility of DRS Parsing and Generation: Challenges and Insights from Multi-lingual Perspective"

Here, we include:

1. **Code:** This folder contains scripts to run semantic parsing and text generation models. 
2. **Evaluation:** This folder contains the scripts to evaluate the experiments reported in the paper. Both parsing and generation folders contain separate evaluation scripts.
3. **model-outputs:** This folder contains the English, Italian, and Urdu model-generated outputs for semantic parsing and generation with and without PGP and GPG pipelines.

Our pre-trained models are publically available at the following link: https://huggingface.co/saadamin2k13
